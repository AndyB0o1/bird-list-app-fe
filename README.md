My Bird List App

React front-end for an app that allows registered users to create and maintain a list of their bird sightings (their "life list"). Uses a Laravel api/back-end and allows logged in users to add, edit and remove bird sightings from their list. Users can record the species, the location and a link to an image url if they have one. Unit tests for the majority of controller methods have been included.
